	 * (6) AWS Access Key ID and (7) Secret Access Key. This is the first of two
	 * pairs of credentials which can be used to access and control basic AWS
	 * services through the API including EC2, S3, SimpleDB, CloudFront, SQS,
	 * EMR, RDS, etc. Some interfaces use this pair, and some use the next pair
	 * below. Pay close attention to the names requested. The Access Key ID is
	 * 20 alpha-numeric characters like 022QF06E7MXBSH9DHM02 and is not secret;
	 * it is available to others in some situations. <b>The Secret Access Key is
	 * 40 alpha-numeric-slash-plus characters like
	 * <code>kWcrlUX5JEDGM/LtmEENI/aVmYvHNif5zB+d9+ct</code> and must be kept
	 * very secret</b>.
